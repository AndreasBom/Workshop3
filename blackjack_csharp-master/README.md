# blackjack_csharp

### The copy that the existed for peer review did not work for others, but it worked locally for me. I copyed and pasted in a new forlder and rebuilded the project and created a new repo. The old files that were corruped should not be gone. I think it was somthing in the Assembly or References.

Fork this code to work with C# in workshop 3.

Contains cs files and project files for Visual Studio 10. Also a modeling project is included, but this project will not load in certain versions of Visual Studio.
